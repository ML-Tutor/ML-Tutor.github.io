My students usually struggle with the material as they do not get their doubts clarified in lectures. This could be due to a number of reasons -- the pace is too high, the class is too big, or they are too shy! This has only gotten worse with online instruction using recorded lectures. Manytimes, they expectations from the faculty is very high, students do not have the right background and struggle to keep up.

A significant portion of my students are working professionals studying for an online degree. They do not necessarily have the bandwidth to attend online office hours or research on their own. I have also coached many professionals prepare for job interviews (no, leetcode does not cut it!)

We have gone from 'almost failing' to an A in individual courses; and from a low GPA (and academic probation) to top-of-class performance and prestigious job offers.

I have worked with some students over multiple years.

I have a systematic approach to tutoring subjects and help students develop their intuition on how to approach problems. This means that we cover a topic such as Dynamic Programming over more than 8 sessions (versus 2-3 in a typical course). I have a large number of practice problems that build on existing knowledge to further firm up understanding

Do you find yourself wondering what is going on in class? Are you following lectures but then find yourself stuck with homework problems? Do you feel your background is lacking
