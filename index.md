Do you struggle to keep up with your professor in class? Do you find that you're missing a key part of the required background material, or that your peers latch onto concepts faster than you do -- and you end up running faster and faster only to stand still?

## Hi! I'm an online tutor and I'm here to help you learn!

I have a PhD from a top-10 University, a long career in industry and have been tutoring students for the past five years.

I have helped students from the following fine institutions:

My students usually struggle with the material as they do not get their doubts clarified in lectures. This could be due to a number of reasons -- the pace is too fast, the class is too big, or they are too shy! This has only gotten worse with online instruction using recorded lectures. Manytimes, they expectations from the faculty is very high; students do not have the right background, and they struggle to keep up.

A significant portion of my students are working professionals studying for an online degree. They do not necessarily have the bandwidth to attend online office hours or research on their own. I have also coached many professionals prepare for job interviews (no, leetcode does not cut it!)

We have gone from 'almost failing' to an A in individual courses; and from a low GPA (and academic probation) to top-of-class performance and prestigious job offers.

# My Approach

I have a systematic approach to tutoring subjects and help students develop their intuition on how to approach problems. This means that we cover a topic such as Dynamic Programming over more than 8 sessions (versus 2-3 in a typical course). I have a large number of practice problems organized systematically that build on your existing knowledge to further firm up understanding.

If you would like to explore the possibility of working together, get in touch: <eecs.tutor0@gmail.com>. My rates are between $150 - $200 per hour, and I am open to working with groups of 2-3 students. The first session is free
